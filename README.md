# Multimedia Delay Meter
This project provides code for an Arduino based multimedia delay measurement device. 

The MM-delay meter generates and captures light pulses and audio signals. When a generated light or audio signal is captured (and recognized) the signal delay is measured with ms accuracy. 

The MM-delay meter stores logs for series of measurements. Logs are timestamped and may be uploaded to UNINETT multimedia delay measurement database (http://delay.uninett.no).
